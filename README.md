🌟 Golang API Backend with Gin, GORM, and PostgreSQL 🌟
📖 Overview
Welcome to the Golang API backend project! This application is built using the Gin web framework and GORM for Object-Relational Mapping (ORM), connecting seamlessly to a PostgreSQL database. The API is designed to handle user registration with email verification, password recovery, and secure user login using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authorization.
🚀 Features

    User Registration: Users can create an account with their email and password.
    Email Verification: A verification email is sent to confirm the user's email address upon registration.
    Password Recovery: Users can request a password reset link via email.
    JWT Authentication: Secure login with JWT tokens for user sessions.
    CRUD Operations: Basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for user management.

🛠 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

    Go (1.16 or later)
    PostgreSQL
    Git

Installation Steps

    Clone the repository:
    bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name

Install dependencies:
bash

go mod tidy

Set up PostgreSQL:

    Create a new PostgreSQL database.
    Update the database connection string in the .env file:
    javascript

    DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/yourdbname?sslmode=disable

Run database migrations:
bash

go run main.go migrate

Start the server:
bash

    go run main.go

💻 Usage
Once the server is running, you can interact with the API using tools like Postman or cURL. Remember to include the JWT token in the Authorization header for protected routes.
Example Request
Register User:
bash

curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/register -d '{"email": "user@example.com", "password": "yourpassword"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
